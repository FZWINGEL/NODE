## **The Continuous-Depth Paradigm: From Residual Networks to Neural Ordinary Differential Equations**

The evolution of deep learning architectures has been characterized by a relentless pursuit of greater expressive power, often achieved by increasing the depth of neural networks. Seminal models such as Residual Networks (ResNets), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and normalizing flows have demonstrated that complex data transformations can be effectively learned by composing a sequence of simpler transformations applied to a hidden state. This iterative process, foundational to modern deep learning, can be mathematically represented by the discrete update rule:  
where h\_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^D represents the hidden state at layer t, and f is a function parameterized by weights \\theta\_t that defines the transformation at that layer. While powerful, this discrete formulation treats each layer as a distinct computational block with its own set of parameters, leading to challenges in memory consumption and hyperparameter tuning as depth increases.  
A transformative conceptual shift arises when viewing this discrete sequence of updates through the lens of numerical analysis. The iterative formula is structurally identical to an explicit Euler discretization of a continuous transformation. This observation prompts a fundamental question: what is the behavior of such a model as the number of layers approaches infinity and the step size between them approaches zero? The limiting case leads to a new paradigm in model design, where the dynamics of the hidden state are no longer defined by a discrete stack of layers but by a continuous vector field parameterized by a single neural network. This gives rise to the concept of a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE).  
Formally, a NODE parameterizes the continuous dynamics of a hidden state h(t) using an ordinary differential equation (ODE) where the derivative function is a neural network:  
In this framework, the notion of discrete layers is replaced by the continuous variable t, which can be interpreted as "depth." The input to the model, h(t\_0), serves as the initial value for an initial value problem (IVP). The final output, h(t\_1), is then the solution to this IVP at time t\_1, obtained by integrating the neural network-defined dynamics over the interval \[t\_0, t\_1\]. This integration is performed by a modern, black-box numerical ODE solver, which can evaluate the dynamics function f at any arbitrary time t to compute the solution to a desired level of precision. Figure 1 provides a visual comparison between the discrete transformations of a ResNet and the continuous trajectory defined by a NODE.  
This continuous-depth formulation offers several profound advantages over its discrete counterparts, fundamentally altering the trade-offs involved in designing and training deep models.

### **Memory Efficiency through the Adjoint Method**

One of the most significant bottlenecks in training very deep neural networks is the memory required to store the activations of each layer during the forward pass, which are needed for gradient computation during backpropagation. The memory cost of this standard approach scales linearly with the number of layers, making extremely deep or finely discretized models computationally prohibitive.  
NODEs circumvent this limitation by leveraging the adjoint sensitivity method, a classic technique from optimal control theory, to compute gradients. Instead of backpropagating through the internal operations of the ODE solver, this method calculates the gradient of a scalar loss L with respect to the model parameters \\theta by solving a second, augmented ODE backward in time. The state of this augmented system includes not only the original hidden state h(t) but also the "adjoint" state a(t) \= \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial h(t)}, which represents the sensitivity of the loss with respect to the hidden state at time t. The dynamics of the adjoint are governed by their own ODE:  
The gradient with respect to the parameters \\theta can then be computed by evaluating another integral that depends on both the state and the adjoint:  
Crucially, all three components—the original state ODE (solved backward), the adjoint ODE, and the parameter gradient integral—can be combined into a single, augmented ODE system and solved with one call to a numerical solver. This process, detailed in Algorithm 1, requires only the final state h(t\_1) and the initial loss gradient \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial h(t\_1)} to reconstruct all necessary gradients. As no intermediate activations from the forward pass need to be stored, the memory cost is constant with respect to the number of function evaluations performed by the solver. This decoupling of memory from "depth" is a paradigm shift, enabling the training of models with dynamics that may require thousands of evaluation steps to solve accurately.  
Furthermore, empirical analysis reveals that this method is not only memory-efficient but can also be computationally superior. The number of function evaluations required for the backward pass using the adjoint method is often significantly lower—sometimes by as much as half—than the number of evaluations in the forward pass. Standard backpropagation would require a gradient computation for every forward-pass function evaluation, whereas the adjoint method's cost is determined by the complexity of the backward-in-time augmented ODE, which may be simpler to solve. This non-obvious computational benefit further solidifies the practicality of NODEs for complex modeling tasks.

### **Adaptive Computation and Error Control**

In a traditional deep network, the computational graph is fixed. The number of layers is a rigid hyperparameter that dictates the computational cost for every input. NODEs, by contrast, delegate the evaluation strategy to the numerical ODE solver. Modern adaptive-step solvers, developed over more than a century of research, provide a sophisticated mechanism for dynamically allocating computational resources.  
These solvers monitor the local truncation error at each step and adjust the step size to ensure that the global error remains within a user-specified tolerance. This has two major implications. First, the computational cost is no longer fixed but becomes input-dependent. An input that can be accurately classified with a simple trajectory will require fewer function evaluations (and thus less computation) than an input requiring a more complex, intricate transformation. Second, the model's precision becomes an explicit, tunable parameter. After training a model at a high tolerance for maximum accuracy, the tolerance can be relaxed at inference time to achieve faster predictions in resource-constrained environments, such as on-device deployment in a battery management system.  
This adaptive nature also manifests during the training process itself. The number of function evaluations (NFEs), which can be seen as an analogue for a model's effective depth, is not static. As the model trains and the learned vector field f becomes more complex to better fit the data, the ODE solver naturally increases the number of evaluations to maintain the requested accuracy. This means the model's complexity and computational cost automatically adapt to the difficulty of the learning task, a level of flexibility absent in fixed-architecture networks.

### **Parameter Efficiency**

The continuous nature of the dynamics function f(h(t), t, \\theta) imposes a strong form of regularization. Since the function is continuous in time t, the transformations applied at infinitesimally close points in "depth" are inherently related. This is in contrast to a ResNet, where the parameters \\theta\_t and \\theta\_{t+1} are, by default, independent. This implicit parameter sharing across depth can lead to more parameter-efficient models. For instance, in supervised learning tasks, a NODE-based architecture has been shown to achieve comparable performance to a ResNet while using significantly fewer parameters. This efficiency is particularly valuable in data-scarce regimes, where models with fewer parameters are less prone to overfitting and can generalize better.

## **Scientific Machine Learning in Electrochemical Systems: Integrating Physics and Data**

The modeling of complex physical systems, such as the electrochemical processes within a lithium-ion battery, presents a fundamental challenge that lies at the intersection of scientific theory and empirical observation. On one hand, physics-based models, derived from first principles like thermodynamics, kinetics, and transport phenomena, offer interpretability and the promise of generalization beyond the specific conditions under which they were calibrated. However, these models are often incomplete, relying on simplifying assumptions to remain tractable, or they become computationally prohibitive high-fidelity simulations that are unsuitable for real-time applications like onboard battery management systems (BMS).  
On the other hand, purely data-driven models, particularly deep learning approaches, have demonstrated remarkable flexibility in learning complex patterns directly from experimental data without requiring a priori knowledge of the underlying physics. Yet, these models often function as "black boxes," lacking interpretability and requiring vast amounts of training data to perform well. More critically, their predictions are not guaranteed to be physically consistent and may fail spectacularly when extrapolating to operating conditions not seen during training.  
Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to bridge this gap, aiming to create synergistic models that combine the strengths of both approaches. The core philosophy of SciML is the integration of domain knowledge, often in the form of differential equations, directly into the machine learning framework. This fusion allows the model to be constrained by known physical laws while using the expressive power of neural networks to learn unmodeled or poorly understood components of the system from data. This hybrid methodology leads to models that are more data-efficient, interpretable, and robust than either approach in isolation.  
Within the context of battery modeling, the continuous-depth framework of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations provides a natural and versatile foundation for implementing various SciML strategies. These strategies can be categorized into a taxonomy based on how they integrate physical knowledge into the learning process.

### **A Taxonomy of SciML Frameworks using Neural ODEs**

The choice of how to combine a neural network with a differential equation is not arbitrary; it reflects a specific assumption about the nature and extent of the available physical knowledge. This leads to a spectrum of methodologies, each suited for different modeling scenarios.  
**1\. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE): The Knowledge-Agnostic Approach** The baseline NODE, as described in the previous chapter, represents the case where the entire dynamics function is parameterized by a neural network: \\frac{dh}{dt} \= f\_{NN}(h, t, \\theta). This approach is ideal when the underlying physical laws are either completely unknown, too complex to formulate mathematically, or when the goal is to discover the dynamics purely from observational data. In battery science, this can be applied to predict the evolution of abstract health indicators or to model emergent phenomena where first-principles models are lacking.  
**2\. Universal Differential Equations (UDE): The Knowledge-Augmenting Approach** A Universal Differential Equation extends the NODE concept by explicitly separating known physics from unknown dynamics. The differential equation is formulated as a hybrid:  
Here, f\_{known} represents a known, albeit incomplete, physical model with parameters p, while the neural network f\_{NN} learns the discrepancy, residual dynamics, or unmodeled physics directly from data. This is arguably one of the most powerful SciML frameworks for battery modeling. For example, one can start with a simplified electrochemical or degradation model and use a neural network to learn the complex, nonlinear effects of temperature, aging, or side reactions that are difficult to model from first principles. This approach retains the interpretable structure of the physical model while using the neural network to "correct" its deficiencies, a design pattern that has been described as **Physics as a Baseline, ML as a Corrector**.  
**3\. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN): The Knowledge-Constraining Approach** Physics-Informed Neural Networks offer an alternative method for incorporating domain knowledge. Instead of embedding the physics into the model's architecture, a PINN uses the governing physical laws as a soft constraint within the loss function. A neural network \\hat{u}(x,t) is trained to approximate the solution of a differential equation. The total loss function is a weighted sum of the data fidelity term and a physics-based residual term:  
where \\mathcal{L}\_{data} \= MSE(\\hat{u}(x\_{data}, t\_{data}), u\_{data}) measures the fit to observed data, and \\mathcal{L}\_{physics} is the mean squared error of the governing differential equation's residual, evaluated at a set of collocation points distributed throughout the domain. For a battery model described by a reaction-diffusion PDE, \\mathcal{A}\[u\] \= f, the physics loss would be \\mathcal{L}\_{physics} \= MSE(\\mathcal{A}\[\\hat{u}\] \- f, 0). This forces the network's output to conform to the known physical laws, even in regions where no training data is available, thereby acting as a powerful regularizer.  
**4\. Hybrid Recurrent Architectures: The Knowledge-Embedding Approach** A fourth strategy involves embedding the physical equations directly as computational layers within a model's architecture, often within a recurrent structure. In this paradigm, the recurrent cell is not a generic LSTM or GRU but is explicitly constructed to perform one step of a numerical integration scheme (e.g., Euler or Runge-Kutta) for a known set of ODEs. For instance, a model for battery state-of-charge can be built where the recurrent update directly implements the discretized Nernst and Butler-Volmer equations. Data-driven components, such as small multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), can then be strategically inserted into this structure to learn correction terms for model-form uncertainty, such as non-ideal internal voltages. This approach tightly couples the physics and the machine learning components, creating a highly structured and interpretable "grey-box" model.  
The choice among these frameworks is a critical modeling decision, dictated by the specific characteristics of the problem at hand. If a well-established but simplified ODE model exists, a UDE is a natural choice to learn the missing terms. If the system is governed by a known PDE without a simple ODE representation, a PINN is more appropriate. If no reliable physical model is available, a physics-constrained NODE may be the best option, using general principles like conservation laws or monotonicity as constraints. This demonstrates that there is no universally superior method; the optimal SciML approach is contingent on the specific knowledge landscape of the problem, providing a practical decision-making framework for researchers and engineers.  
The following table provides a comparative summary of these methodologies, highlighting their core principles and applications in battery modeling.

| Methodology | Core Principle | Integration of Physics | Primary Battery Application | Strengths | Limitations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Neural ODE (NODE)** | Parameterize the entire derivative function \\frac{dh}{dt} with a neural network. | Implicitly, through data patterns, or via architectural/loss constraints (e.g., monotonicity). | Learning unknown dynamics of SEI growth ; SoH forecasting from data. | Highly flexible; capable of discovering novel dynamics from data. | Prone to physical inconsistency; requires constraints for robust extrapolation. |
| **Universal DE (UDE)** | Augment a known (but incomplete) physical model with a neural network to learn the residual dynamics. | Architectural: f\_{total} \= f\_{known} \+ f\_{NN}. | Forecasting calendar and cycle degradation by correcting empirical models. | Balances interpretability and flexibility; data-efficient; physically grounded. | Requires a partial physical model to build upon. |
| **Physics-Informed NN (PINN)** | Use a neural network to approximate the solution of a DE; enforce the DE as a soft constraint in the loss function. | Loss Function: \\mathcal{L} \= \\mathcal{L}\_{data} \+ \\lambda \\mathcal{L}\_{physics}. | Solving reaction-diffusion PDEs for SOC/SOH estimation. | Strong regularization; enforces physics in data-sparse regions. | Can be difficult to train due to the need to balance multiple loss terms. |
| **Hybrid Recurrent Architecture** | Construct a recurrent neural network where the update rule is a numerical integration step of a known physical model. | Architectural: The recurrent cell explicitly implements discretized physical equations. | State-of-charge tracking using Nernst and Butler-Volmer equations. | Highly interpretable "grey-box" model; computationally efficient for real-time use. | Less flexible than UDEs; structure is tied to a specific set of equations. |

## **Modeling Microscopic Phenomena: SEI Growth Dynamics with Physics-Constrained NODEs**

The Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) is a nanometer-scale passivation layer that forms at the interface between the negative electrode and the electrolyte in lithium-ion batteries. Its formation, primarily during the initial charging cycles, and its continued evolution throughout the battery's life are critical determinants of cell performance, lifetime, and safety. The SEI's properties govern ionic transport, prevent further electrolyte decomposition, and are implicated in capacity fade through the consumption of lithium ions. Modeling the growth of the SEI is therefore a central challenge in battery science.  
SEI growth is a complex, self-limiting process that can be described by an ordinary differential equation relating the growth rate to the current SEI thickness and other operating conditions. Numerous mechanistic models have been proposed, attributing the rate-limiting step to various physical phenomena such as solvent diffusion, electron migration, electron tunneling, or lithium interstitial diffusion. However, identifying the correct mechanism or combination of mechanisms for a given battery chemistry and operating condition is a tedious, iterative process. This ambiguity makes SEI growth an ideal candidate for discovery-oriented modeling using NODEs.

### **The NODE-Based Approach for Discovering Growth Rate Functions**

The core strategy is to reframe the problem of identifying the SEI growth mechanism as a function approximation task. The governing ODE for SEI thickness, L\_{SEI}, can be written in a general form:  
where u(t) represents external variables, such as the anode potential \\phi\_{ne}, and g is the unknown growth rate function that we aim to discover. A NODE approach parameterizes this unknown function g with a neural network, which takes the current state (L\_{SEI}) and inputs (\\phi\_{ne}) and outputs the instantaneous growth rate. The model is then trained to fit time-series data of SEI thickness, which can be obtained either experimentally or, for controlled analysis, from a high-fidelity mechanistic model.  
In a study by Ramasubramanian et al., this approach was tested in a controlled setting where synthetic SEI thickness data was generated from a known mechanistic model combining electron tunneling and lithium interstitial diffusion. This setup provides a "ground truth" for the growth rate function, allowing for a direct comparison between the function learned by the NODE and the true underlying physics.

### **The Perils of Unconstrained Learning: Performance of the Baseline NODE**

A baseline NODE model ("BaseNODE"), consisting of a simple multi-layer perceptron with two hidden layers, was trained on the synthetic SEI thickness data. The results highlight a critical pitfall of naive data-driven modeling. While the BaseNODE achieved an excellent fit to the training data, with a sum of squared errors (SSE) of approximately 0.03 nm², its predictive performance on two different validation protocols was extremely poor. The SSE on Validation Protocol A was over 200 nm², and on Protocol B, it exceeded 860 nm²—errors orders of magnitude larger than the training error.  
A post-hoc analysis of the function learned by the BaseNODE reveals the cause of this failure. When visualizing the learned growth rate function across a range of SEI thicknesses and anode potentials, it becomes clear that the model learned a physically inconsistent representation of the process. In regions of the input space not well-covered by the training data—specifically at high anode potentials and high SEI thicknesses—the model predicted a *negative* growth rate. This is physically impossible, as SEI growth is considered an irreversible process.  
This outcome is a direct consequence of the universal approximation theorem being a double-edged sword. A neural network, as a universal approximator, is capable of learning any continuous function. However, during optimization, it will converge to a function that minimizes the loss on the training data, without any inherent preference for the physically correct one. When the training data is sparse, as is often the case in physical experiments, there are vast regions of the input space where the model's behavior is unconstrained. The optimization process may find it "easier" (e.g., requiring smaller weight adjustments) to fit the training points with a function that dips into negative values in these unconstrained regions rather than learning the true, complex, and strictly non-negative exponential decay function. The model's failure is therefore not a flaw in the NODE concept itself, but a predictable result of applying an unconstrained, highly flexible function approximator to a problem with known physical constraints that were not enforced.

### **The Critical Role of Augmentations and Physical Constraints**

To address the poor generalization of the BaseNODE, several augmentation strategies were investigated, each designed to inject some form of domain knowledge into the learning process. The comparative success of these strategies provides a powerful lesson in the application of SciML to physical systems.

1. **Physics-Based Feature Engineering:** This approach involves transforming the model's inputs based on physical intuition. Recognizing that many SEI growth models exhibit an exponential dependence on anode potential, one variant fed the network with an exponential transformation of the voltage, exp(-\\phi\_{ne}), instead of the raw potential. This pre-processing helps to align the input with the expected functional form, making the learning task easier for the neural network.  
2. **Physics-Based Architectural Constraints:** This strategy embeds a fundamental physical principle directly into the model's architecture. The irreversible nature of SEI growth implies that the growth rate must always be non-negative. This constraint was enforced by changing the activation function of the network's output layer from linear to a softplus function, Y \= log(1 \+ exp(X)), which guarantees a positive output for any input. This architectural modification fundamentally restricts the hypothesis space of the model, forbidding it from ever learning a physically impossible negative growth rate.  
3. **Data Augmentation:** This involves enriching the training dataset. An additional constant-voltage (CV) phase was simulated and added to the end of the original formation protocol. This provided the model with more data points in the region of low growth rates at high SEI thicknesses, where the BaseNODE had previously failed.

### **Quantitative Analysis and a Hierarchy of Interventions**

The performance of these different strategies, both individually and in combination, was quantitatively evaluated. The results, summarized from the study, reveal a clear hierarchy in their effectiveness at improving generalization.  
The analysis of different model variants demonstrates that incorporating physical knowledge is paramount for achieving robust and generalizable models. The most dramatic improvement came from the architectural constraint. A model with only the non-negative output constraint (Variant V) reduced the validation SSE on Protocol A from 200.32 nm² to a mere 0.67 nm², and on Protocol B from 863.11 nm² to 1.39 nm². In contrast, a model with only data augmentation (Variant II) still produced large validation errors (138.21 nm² and 324.03 nm², respectively), showing only marginal improvement over the baseline. Feature engineering alone (Variant IV) provided a moderate improvement on one protocol but performed extremely poorly on the other, indicating that this strategy can be brittle.  
This stark comparison leads to a powerful conclusion: embedding a single, fundamental piece of physical knowledge (irreversibility) as a hard architectural constraint is far more effective at improving model generalization than simply providing more data or giving hints about the functional form of the solution. The combination of all three augmentations (Variant III) yielded the best performance on one of the validation protocols, suggesting that these strategies can be complementary. However, the primary driver of success was the enforcement of physical consistency. The following table, synthesized from the data in Ramasubramanian et al., provides a quantitative summary of these findings.

| Variant ID | Augmentation Type(s) | Training SSE (nm²) | Validation SSE (Protocol A, nm²) | Validation SSE (Protocol B, nm²) | Key Observation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **BaseNODE** | None | 0.03 | 200.32 | 863.11 | Excellent fit, catastrophic generalization due to unphysical predictions. |
| **Variant II** | Data Augmentation | 0.18 | 138.21 | 324.03 | Minor improvement; more data is insufficient to enforce physical consistency. |
| **Variant IV** | Feature Engineering | 0.12 | 42.36 | 329724.89 | Inconsistent performance; helpful on one protocol, detrimental on another. |
| **Variant V** | Physics-Based Constraints | 0.10 | **0.67** | 1.39 | **Dramatic improvement**; enforcing non-negativity is the single most effective strategy. |
| **Variant I** | Feature Eng. \+ Constraints | 0.07 | 4.72 | 1.50 | Strong performance, dominated by the effect of the constraint. |
| **Variant III** | All Three Augmentations | 0.04 | 7.92 | **0.46** | Best performance on Protocol B, showing synergistic effects are possible. |
| **Variant VII** | Data Aug. \+ Constraints | 0.16 | 14.58 | 2.77 | Strong performance, again highlighting the primary importance of constraints. |

This case study on SEI growth serves as a compelling demonstration that for physical systems, the successful application of NODEs—and SciML methods more broadly—hinges on the thoughtful integration of domain knowledge. Naively applying these powerful tools as black-box function approximators can lead to models that learn spurious, unphysical correlations. By contrast, embedding even simple, fundamental physical principles as architectural or loss-based constraints can transform a poorly generalizing model into a robust and predictive scientific tool.

## **Forecasting Battery Lifespan: Predicting State of Health and Remaining Useful Life**

While modeling microscopic phenomena like SEI growth provides fundamental insights, a primary industrial application of battery modeling is the prediction of macroscopic, system-level behavior over the entire operational lifespan. The key metrics for this are the State of Health (SoH) and the Remaining Useful Life (RUL). SoH is a figure of merit, typically expressed as a percentage, that quantifies the current condition of a battery relative to its fresh state, often defined by its capacity to store charge. RUL is the prediction of how much longer a battery can be used before its SoH drops below a predefined failure threshold, commonly set at 80% of its initial capacity. Accurate SoH and RUL forecasting is essential for optimizing performance, ensuring reliability, and managing the lifecycle of battery-powered systems, from electric vehicles to grid-scale energy storage.  
The degradation of a battery is a complex process driven by a combination of mechanisms that are broadly categorized into two types: calendar degradation and cycle degradation.

* **Calendar Degradation:** This refers to the irreversible loss of capacity that occurs over time, even when the battery is at rest. It is strongly dependent on storage conditions, particularly temperature and state of charge (SoC). The underlying chemical processes, such as the continued growth of the SEI layer, are often modeled using an Arrhenius formulation to capture the temperature dependency.  
* **Cycle Degradation:** This form of degradation is caused by the repeated charging and discharging of the battery. The physical stresses of lithium ion intercalation and deintercalation, along with electrochemical side reactions that are accelerated during current flow, lead to phenomena like particle cracking, loss of active material, and increased internal resistance. Cycle degradation is a function of usage patterns, including discharge current, depth of discharge, and operating temperature.

The total degradation of a battery is the cumulative effect of both calendar and cycle aging, which are often modeled as additive for simplicity, though their interaction can be complex. The evolution of SoH over time is thus a dynamic process that can be described by a set of ordinary differential equations.

### **The NODE and UDE Approaches to Degradation Forecasting**

The continuous-time framework of NODEs and UDEs is exceptionally well-suited for modeling the long-term dynamics of battery degradation.  
**1\. The Pure NODE Approach** In this approach, a single neural network is tasked with learning the entire degradation dynamics from time-series data of battery capacity or SoH. The model learns the time derivative of the total degradation, \\frac{dq\_{total}}{dt}, as a function of the key stress factors:  
The inputs to the neural network can include a comprehensive set of variables known to influence aging, such as time, temperature (T\_b), state of charge (SoC), current (I\_b), capacity (Q), and voltage (V). By integrating the output of this neural network over time, one can forecast the entire SoH trajectory of the battery. This black-box approach is particularly useful when the specific forms of the degradation equations are unknown or vary significantly across different battery chemistries.  
**2\. The Universal Differential Equation (UDE) Approach** The UDE approach offers a more structured, hybrid methodology. It starts with known, physics-based or empirical models for calendar and cycle degradation and uses neural networks to replace or augment the most uncertain or difficult-to-model components of these equations. For example, a study by Murgai et al. constructs a UDE for cumulative degradation by combining the Arrhenius model for calendar aging and the Wang model for cycle aging. Instead of using the empirical forms in their entirety, they replace specific terms with neural networks:

* In the calendar degradation equation, the simplified time-dependency term (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{t}}) is replaced with a neural network, NN\_1(t). This allows the model to learn the complex, non-linear time evolution of calendar aging directly from data, which is crucial for accurate long-term performance prediction.  
* The entire cycle degradation term, which in the Wang model is a complex empirical function with many fitted constants, is replaced with a second neural network, NN\_2(T\_b, I\_b, Q). This reduces the model's reliance on pre-calibrated empirical constants and enables it to learn intricate usage-dependent degradation patterns from data, making the model more flexible and precise.

The resulting UDE takes the form:  
This hybrid structure retains the interpretable framework of the physical models while delegating the learning of complex, data-dependent behaviors to the neural networks. This design pattern, where a physical model provides a baseline and a machine learning component learns the residual or unmodeled dynamics, is a recurring and powerful theme in hybrid battery modeling. It is philosophically identical to other hybrid approaches, such as a model that uses an LSTM to learn a voltage correction term to add to the output of a Single Particle Model (SPM). Both methods leverage **Physics as a Baseline, ML as a Corrector**.

### **Performance, Validation, and the Impact of Early-Cycle Prediction**

The efficacy of these SciML models is demonstrated through their ability to make accurate, long-term forecasts using only data from the early stages of a battery's life. Models were trained and validated using both synthetic data generated from ground-truth equations (with added noise to simulate measurement uncertainty) and real-world experimental cycling data from Sandia National Laboratories.  
The quantitative results are compelling. On synthetic data, the UDE and NODE models achieved low mean squared errors (MSE) of 9.90 and 11.55, respectively, when forecasting over multi-year timespans. On experimental data, the UDE achieved an even lower loss of 1.6980, indicating a close match to real-world degradation trajectories.  
The ability of these models to forecast lifespan from *early-cycle data* represents a significant breakthrough for the battery industry. Historically, a major challenge in battery prognostics has been that significant capacity degradation is often not observable until well into a battery's life. Many cells exhibit a long "plateau" phase with negligible capacity fade before a more rapid "knee" point and subsequent decline. Traditional empirical models often require data that extends into this degradation phase (e.g., observing at least 25% of the degradation trajectory) to reliably extrapolate a trend.  
SciML models, by learning the underlying *dynamics* (the derivative of SoH) rather than simply curve-fitting the SoH itself, are able to detect subtle changes in electrochemical behavior from early cycles that are precursors to later degradation. Features like the evolution of the discharge voltage curve shape, which are implicitly captured by the neural network, correlate with cycle life long before macroscopic capacity fade becomes apparent. This capability enables transformative applications such as:

* **Rapid Manufacturing Quality Control:** New cells can be sorted and graded by their expected lifetime immediately after the initial formation cycles, rather than after months of testing.  
* **Accelerated Cell Development:** The validation of new materials, chemistries, and manufacturing processes can be drastically shortened.  
* **Optimized Deployment:** Batteries can be allocated to different applications based on their predicted longevity, maximizing the value of the entire fleet.

This shift from late-stage extrapolation to early-stage dynamic forecasting is a major economic and engineering implication of the technology, promising to reduce the time and cost associated with battery development and deployment significantly.

## **Advanced Architectures for Complex Battery Dynamics**

While the foundational concepts of NODEs and UDEs provide a powerful toolkit for battery modeling, the complexity of electrochemical systems often necessitates more specialized and sophisticated architectures. Advanced frameworks have been developed that extend the core NODE idea to handle systems with intricate relational structures, to formally quantify predictive uncertainty, and to more deeply integrate physical knowledge. These approaches represent the cutting edge of differentiable battery modeling.

### **Universal Differential Equations: Augmenting Physical Models with Neural Networks**

The Universal Differential Equation (UDE) framework represents a principled approach to hybrid modeling, where the goal is not to replace a physical model but to surgically enhance it. The core idea is to identify the components of an existing differential equation model that are most uncertain, empirically derived, or computationally difficult, and to replace precisely those components with neural networks. This act of "model surgery" balances the retention of trusted physical laws with the data-driven flexibility of machine learning.  
The degradation forecasting model from Murgai et al. serves as a prime example of this targeted approach. The full degradation ODE is constructed as:  
In this formulation, the designers made several critical choices. They retained the well-established Arrhenius term, \\exp(-E\_a/RT\_b), which captures the fundamental temperature dependence of chemical reactions. This part of the model is grounded in first-principles physics and is considered reliable. However, they replaced two less certain components:

1. **The time-dependency of calendar aging:** Simple models often use an empirical term like \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{t}}. This was replaced by NN\_1(t), a neural network that can learn a much more complex and accurate representation of how calendar aging evolves over long timescales.  
2. **The entire cycle degradation model:** The original Wang model for cycle degradation is a heavily empirical function with numerous fitted constants that are specific to one battery chemistry and set of conditions. This entire term was replaced by NN\_2(T\_b, I\_b, Q), allowing the model to learn the intricate, nonlinear dependencies of cycle aging on temperature, current, and capacity directly from data.

This targeted replacement strategy makes the UDE highly data-efficient. Instead of learning the entire vector field from scratch, the neural networks only need to learn the "missing physics" or the residual dynamics, a task that typically requires less data and is less prone to overfitting. The resulting model is more generalizable across diverse operating conditions than the original empirical model and more interpretable than a pure black-box NODE.

### **Incorporating Relational Dynamics: The Synergy of Graph Neural Networks and NODEs**

Standard ODE models describe the evolution of a system's state as a whole or the independent evolution of its components. However, many real-world systems, including battery packs, consist of multiple interacting entities. The state of one component directly influences the dynamics of its neighbors. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are designed to handle such relational data, making their integration with NODEs a natural step for modeling complex, multi-component systems.  
In a GNN-ODE framework, the system is represented as a dynamic graph where nodes correspond to individual components (e.g., battery cells in a pack, particles in an electrode) and edges represent the interactions between them (e.g., thermal transfer, electrical connection). The architecture then separates the modeling of self-dynamics from interaction dynamics:

* **The GNN's Role:** At each time step during the ODE integration, the GNN's message-passing mechanism is used to compute the interaction forces or influences on each node. It aggregates information from a node's neighbors to determine the component of the derivative that arises from interactions.  
* **The NODE's Role:** The NODE solver takes the forces computed by the GNN (along with any self-dynamics) and integrates the state of all nodes forward in time by a small step.

This powerful combination allows the model to learn the rules of local interaction while simulating the global evolution of the system. A key extension is the **Signed Graph Neural ODE (SGODE)**, which is designed for systems with both positive (cooperative or stabilizing) and negative (antagonistic or destabilizing) interactions. The SGODE learns a signed adjacency matrix, allowing it to distinguish between different types of relationships.  
While not explicitly detailed in the provided materials for a battery application, this framework has direct and compelling relevance. For instance, it provides a natural architecture for modeling **thermal runaway propagation in a battery pack**. In this scenario:

1. Each battery cell is a node in the graph.  
2. The state of each node is its temperature.  
3. Edges represent pathways for heat transfer between adjacent cells.  
4. The GNN would learn the physics of heat transfer (conduction, convection) as the interaction function.  
5. The NODE would integrate the temperature of each cell over time, governed by the heat generated internally and the heat transferred from its neighbors. An SGODE could further enhance this model by representing heat propagation to a neighboring cell as a "negative" (destabilizing) interaction, while heat dissipation to a cooling system could be modeled as a "positive" (stabilizing) interaction. This provides a clear path toward building high-fidelity, spatially-aware models for battery safety and thermal management.

### **Quantifying Predictive Confidence: Bayesian Approaches to Neural ODEs**

For high-stakes applications like battery prognostics, a single, deterministic prediction of RUL is insufficient. A robust system must also provide a measure of confidence or uncertainty in its forecast to enable risk-informed decision-making. Bayesian methods provide a formal framework for achieving this uncertainty quantification (UQ). Integrating these methods with NODEs creates models that can produce a distribution of possible future trajectories rather than a single one.  
There is a spectrum of approaches for creating Bayesian NODEs, reflecting different assumptions about the sources of uncertainty:

1. **Bayesian Neural ODEs (BNODEs):** This is the foundational approach, where Bayesian inference is applied to the weights of the neural network that defines the ODE's dynamics. Instead of learning a single set of optimal weights, the model learns a posterior distribution over the weights. Predictions are made by sampling multiple sets of weights from this posterior, solving the ODE for each sample, and thus generating an ensemble of output trajectories. This distribution reflects the model's uncertainty about the true underlying dynamics function.  
2. **Physics-Constrained Bayesian Neural Networks:** This approach refines the BNODE by being more specific about the source of uncertainty. In a model by Najera-Flores et al., a DeepONet-inspired architecture is used, with a "branch" network processing the battery's historical features and a "trunk" network handling the time evolution. Crucially, the Bayesian variational layers are placed only in the branch network. This embodies the assumption that the epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty) stems from not knowing how a specific battery's unique history maps to its degradation parameters, while the fundamental form of time evolution is more deterministic. This targeted application of Bayesian layers isolates the uncertainty where it is most physically meaningful.  
3. **Hybrid Bayesian Physics-Informed Models:** This strategy applies Bayesian principles at a higher level of abstraction—not just for neural network weights, but for the parameters of the physical model itself and for fusing data from different sources. In a framework proposed by Nascimento et al., variational Bayesian nodes are used to model key physical parameters like total resistance (R\_0) and maximum charge (q^{max}) as distributions, capturing battery-to-battery variability. Furthermore, a Bayesian updating scheme is employed to treat data from a fleet of similar batteries as a "prior" belief about a new battery's behavior. As battery-specific data (even from partial discharge cycles or with an unknown usage history) becomes available, this prior is updated to yield a more accurate, individualized "posterior" model.

This latter capability represents a significant practical breakthrough. It means that effective, individualized battery health management can be achieved without requiring costly and disruptive full characterization cycles. Models can be updated "on the fly" during normal operation by fusing population-level knowledge with individual-level observations. This dramatically lowers the barrier to implementing advanced, data-driven prognostics in real-world fleets of electric vehicles or energy storage systems, making personalized battery health management a scalable reality.

## **Synthesis and Future Directions in Differentiable Battery Modeling**

The exploration of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations and their variants within the Scientific Machine Learning paradigm has opened a new frontier in the modeling of complex electrochemical systems. By moving from discrete, layered architectures to continuous-depth models governed by learned dynamics, these methods offer a powerful synthesis of the flexibility of machine learning and the rigor of physics-based modeling. This report has analyzed a spectrum of these approaches, from foundational NODEs to advanced hybrid architectures, and their application to critical challenges in battery science, including SEI growth, degradation forecasting, and uncertainty quantification.

### **A Comparative Synthesis of Methodologies**

The various frameworks discussed each occupy a unique niche in the modeling landscape, defined by their approach to integrating domain knowledge and their suitability for different types of problems.

* **Neural ODEs (NODEs)** serve as the most flexible, knowledge-agnostic baseline. They excel at discovering dynamics from data when first-principles models are unavailable but, as demonstrated in the SEI growth case study, require the imposition of physical constraints to ensure robust generalization.  
* **Universal Differential Equations (UDEs)** represent a powerful middle ground, ideal for augmenting existing but incomplete physical models. By surgically replacing uncertain or empirical terms with neural networks, they create data-efficient, interpretable hybrid models that have shown high precision in long-term degradation forecasting.  
* **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** are best suited for systems governed by well-defined partial differential equations, using the physics as a strong regularizer in the loss function. Their application is most natural for modeling spatio-temporal phenomena like reaction-diffusion processes within electrodes.  
* **Graph Neural Network-ODEs (GNN-ODEs)** are the premier architecture for multi-component systems with explicit, local interactions. Their potential for modeling thermal dynamics and failure propagation in entire battery packs is a significant, albeit underexplored, application area.  
* **Bayesian NODE variants** are indispensable for any application where prognostics must inform risk assessment. By providing a formal framework for uncertainty quantification, they transform deterministic predictions into probabilistic forecasts, enabling more reliable and safe battery management.

Across these diverse methods, several overarching themes emerge. First is the unequivocal necessity of embedding physical knowledge. Whether through architectural constraints (non-negativity), model composition (UDEs), loss function regularization (PINNs), or Bayesian priors, the integration of domain knowledge is the key factor that elevates these models from simple curve-fitters to predictive scientific tools. Second is the power of the hybrid modeling philosophy—particularly the "Physics as a Baseline, ML as a Corrector" pattern—which consistently yields models that are more robust and data-efficient than either pure-physics or pure-ML approaches. Finally, the move toward probabilistic prognostics via Bayesian methods marks a maturation of the field, acknowledging that for safety-critical systems, knowing what the model *doesn't* know is as important as what it predicts.

### **Future Research Directions**

The continued development and application of differentiable battery modeling point toward several exciting and impactful future directions.

1. **Application to Next-Generation Batteries:** The majority of current research focuses on conventional lithium-ion chemistries. A major opportunity lies in applying these SciML methods to emerging technologies like all-solid-state batteries, where degradation mechanisms are novel and less understood. The discovery-oriented nature of UDEs and constrained NODEs makes them ideal tools for elucidating the physics of these new systems from early experimental data.  
2. **Scalability and Onboard Implementation:** For these advanced models to be deployed in real-world battery management systems, they must be computationally efficient. Research into model compression techniques, hardware-aware neural architecture search, and the development of highly optimized, low-precision ODE solvers will be crucial for enabling these complex models to run on resource-constrained onboard microcontrollers.  
3. **Automated Scientific Discovery:** The synergy between UDEs and symbolic regression techniques presents a compelling path toward automated model discovery. After a UDE has learned the "missing physics" term as a neural network, algorithms like Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) can be applied to distill this learned black-box function into a simple, interpretable symbolic equation. This would complete the cycle from data to knowledge, using machine learning not just to predict, but to propose new physical laws.  
4. **Integrated Multi-Physics Modeling:** Battery degradation is a coupled, multi-physics problem involving electrochemical, thermal, and mechanical phenomena (e.g., particle cracking due to mechanical stress). Future work should focus on developing unified SciML frameworks that can model these coupled systems simultaneously. This could involve systems of coupled GNN-ODEs, where different node types represent different physical domains, allowing the model to learn the intricate feedback loops between chemical aging, heat generation, and mechanical stress.  
5. **From Prediction to Control:** Perhaps the most transformative future application lies beyond prediction and in the realm of control. Because these models are fully differentiable, they can be integrated directly into optimal control frameworks. An accurate, differentiable model of battery degradation allows for the computation of the gradient of battery lifetime with respect to the charging or discharging protocol. This gradient can then be used to optimize the control inputs (i.e., the current profile) to actively *minimize* degradation and extend battery life. This moves beyond a passive, prognostic BMS to an active, prescriptive one that intelligently manages the battery to maximize its value. The differentiability inherent in the NODE paradigm is the key enabling technology for this leap, representing the next frontier in the development of truly "smart" battery systems.
