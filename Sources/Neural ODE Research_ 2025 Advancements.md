### **Executive Summary**

The year 2025 has marked a pivotal maturation point for the field of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Since their introduction as a continuous-depth alternative to discrete deep networks, the research landscape has evolved from exploring the novelty of the core concept to a sophisticated, multi-faceted effort aimed at bolstering theoretical foundations, solving critical engineering bottlenecks, and expanding applicability through widespread hybridization. This report synthesizes the key academic advancements of 2025, revealing a field that is increasingly characterized by mathematical rigor, architectural ingenuity, and a focus on domain-specific, interpretable solutions.

Four dominant trends emerge from the contemporary literature. First is a profound shift towards **mathematical formalism**, where the black-box dynamics function of the original Neural ODE is augmented or replaced with structured mathematical constructs. Innovations such as Symbolic Neural ODEs (SNODEs) for equation discovery, Event Transition Tensors for high-order dynamic analysis, and Characteristic-Curve NODEs (C-NODEs) for enhanced expressivity signal a move to reclaim these models within the formalisms of dynamical systems and mathematical physics. Second, 2025 has witnessed the proliferation of **hybrid architectures**, cementing the role of Neural ODEs as a fundamental "dynamics module." Their integration with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model complex spatio-temporal systems, with Transformers to create continuous-depth language models, and with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for probabilistic model order reduction demonstrates their versatility. Third, a concerted effort has been made to address **practical bottlenecks** that have historically limited deployment. Novel techniques for handling stiff systems, accelerating training through simultaneous optimization, and developing a native toolkit of continuous-time normalization and regularization methods are making Neural ODEs more efficient, stable, and robust. Finally, there is a clear trajectory towards building **interpretable, domain-specific models** for high-stakes applications. The development of transparent classifiers for healthcare and physics-informed models for materials science underscores a growing demand for models that not only predict but also explain, leveraging the intrinsic interpretability of the learned vector fields. Collectively, these advancements paint a picture of a field that has successfully navigated its initial hype cycle and is now producing a rich ecosystem of powerful, practical, and theoretically grounded continuous-depth models poised for significant real-world impact.

## **I. The Neural Ordinary Differential Equation: A Continuous-Depth Paradigm**

### **1.1 Revisiting the Core Principles: From ResNets to Continuous Dynamics**

The conceptual genesis of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) lies in a profound reinterpretation of the architecture of deep Residual Networks (ResNets).16 A standard ResNet constructs a complex transformation by composing a discrete sequence of hidden layers, where the update rule for a hidden state $h\_t$ is given by:

$$h\_{t+1} \= h\_t \+ f(h\_t, \\theta\_t)$$  
Here, $f$ represents a neural network layer (a residual block) with parameters $\\theta\_t$. In their seminal 2018 work, Chen et al. observed that this update rule is analogous to a single step of the forward Euler method for numerically solving an ordinary differential equation.16 By taking this analogy to its logical conclusion and considering the limit as the step size approaches zero, the discrete sequence of layers is transformed into a continuous evolution of the hidden state $h(t)$ governed by an ODE:

$$\\frac{dh(t)}{dt} \= f(h(t), t, \\theta)$$  
In this continuous-depth paradigm, the entire stack of residual blocks is replaced by a single neural network, $f$, which parameterizes the derivative of the hidden state with respect to a continuous variable $t$, often interpreted as "depth".16 The output of this "ODE network" is no longer computed by a fixed number of layer-by-layer transformations but by invoking a black-box numerical ODE solver to integrate the dynamics from an initial time (and initial state) $t\_0$ to a final time $t\_1$.16

This reframing introduced several compelling advantages over its discrete counterparts. First, it offered **constant memory cost** during training, a significant departure from conventional networks that must store activations for each layer. Second, it enabled **adaptive computation**. Modern adaptive ODE solvers can adjust their evaluation strategy on the fly, taking more steps in regions where the dynamics are complex and fewer where they are simple, allowing the computational cost to scale with the difficulty of the input.16 Third, it provided an explicit mechanism to **trade numerical precision for speed** by simply adjusting the error tolerance of the ODE solver at inference time.17

### **1.2 The Adjoint Sensitivity Method: Enabling Memory-Efficient Training**

The promise of constant memory cost is realized through a critical algorithmic innovation: the adjoint sensitivity method.16 Standard backpropagation through a deep network requires storing the entire computation graph—specifically, the intermediate activations at each layer—to compute gradients. For a continuous-depth model with a potentially infinite number of "layers," this is impossible. The adjoint method circumvents this by calculating gradients without needing to access the forward-pass trajectory directly.16

To optimize a loss function $L$, which depends on the state at the final time, $z(t\_1)$, one needs the gradient of the loss with respect to the model parameters, $\\partial L / \\partial \\theta$. The first step is to determine how the loss depends on the hidden state $z(t)$ at every instant in time. This quantity is known as the adjoint, $a(t) \= \\partial L / \\partial z(t)$. The dynamics of the adjoint are themselves governed by another ODE, which can be seen as the instantaneous analogue of the chain rule 16:

$$\\frac{da(t)}{dt} \= \-a(t)^T \\frac{\\partial f(z(t), t, \\theta)}{\\partial z}$$  
This ODE must be solved *backwards* in time, from an initial condition $a(t\_1) \= \\partial L / \\partial z(t\_1)$. The gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters $\\theta$ can then be computed by integrating a third expression, also backwards in time:

$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta} \= \- \\int\_{t\_1}^{t\_0} a(t)^T \\frac{\\partial f(z(t), t, \\theta)}{\\partial \\theta} dt$$  
Crucially, all three of these integrals—the forward pass for $z(t)$, the backward pass for $a(t)$, and the backward pass for the parameter gradients—can be computed by a single call to an augmented ODE solver. This process scales linearly with the size of the problem and has a low, constant memory cost, as intermediate states do not need to be stored.16 This technique is the cornerstone that makes end-to-end training of Neural ODEs within larger models computationally feasible.

### **1.3 Initial Promises and Foundational Limitations**

The initial promise of Neural ODEs extended beyond memory efficiency. Their continuous-time nature made them a natural fit for modeling irregularly-sampled time-series data, where traditional recurrent models often require imputation or other preprocessing steps.20 They also enabled the construction of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs), a class of generative models that can be trained directly by maximum likelihood without the architectural constraints (e.g., partitioning or ordering dimensions) required by their discrete counterparts.16

However, as the field explored these models, several foundational limitations became apparent, setting the stage for the research landscape of 2025\. The most significant of these were:

1. **High Computational Cost:** Despite memory efficiency, training remained slow. Each forward pass requires an ODE solve, and this process must be repeated for every iteration of the training loop, leading to high computational overhead.8  
2. **Numerical Instability with Stiff Systems:** Many real-world dynamical systems are "stiff," meaning they contain components that evolve on vastly different timescales. Standard explicit ODE solvers become extremely inefficient and unstable when faced with stiffness, demanding prohibitively small time steps.10  
3. **Opacity of Learned Dynamics:** The neural network $f$ that parameterizes the dynamics typically operates as a "black box." This lack of transparency and interpretability hinders trust, makes it difficult to incorporate prior physical knowledge, and limits the model's utility for scientific discovery.3  
4. **Limited Expressivity:** It was discovered that standard Neural ODEs are topologically constrained and cannot, for example, learn to represent trajectories that intersect, limiting their ability to model certain classes of functions and flows.4

The initial formulation of Neural ODEs was a powerful but, in some sense, "naive" framework. It treated the dynamics function $f$ as a generic, unstructured approximator and the ODE solver as an interchangeable, off-the-shelf component. The research of 2025 represents a collective and sophisticated response to these foundational limitations. It marks a clear transition from the novelty of the core idea to a more mature phase focused on infusing the architecture with greater mathematical structure, engineering robustness, and domain-specific intelligence. Each of the subsequent sections in this report can be understood as a direct and targeted effort to address one or more of these initial challenges.

## **II. Advances in Core Neural ODE Architectures and Theory**

The research of 2025 has moved beyond viewing Neural ODEs as mere continuous analogues of discrete networks, instead treating them as first-class mathematical objects. This has led to a "mathematization" of the field, where core architectures are being augmented with formalisms from symbolic mathematics, differential geometry, and operator theory. This trend is a direct response to the limitations of the original black-box formulation, aiming to enhance interpretability, expressivity, and analytical rigor.

### **2.1 Symbolic Neural ODEs (SNODEs): Bridging Connectionism and Symbolism for Enhanced Interpretability**

A primary criticism of standard Neural ODEs is the opacity of the learned dynamics function $f$. The Symbolic Neural ODE (SNODE) framework, proposed by Li et al., directly confronts this issue by integrating the strengths of symbolic reasoning with the flexibility of connectionist models.1 The goal is not only to predict the evolution of a system but also to uncover an interpretable, symbolic representation of its underlying governing equations.22

The SNODE framework employs a structured, three-stage learning process 1:

1. **Stage 1: Pre-training via Gradient Flow Matching.** The process begins with a predefined symbolic neural network (SymNet). This network is not a generic multilayer perceptron; instead, it constructs an input dictionary from symbolic components of the system's state, such as state variables, parameters, and their derivatives.2 This SymNet is pre-trained to align its output with the true gradients of the system's dynamics using a flow matching strategy. This initial stage circumvents the challenges of high computational loss and local optima that often plague traditional symbolic regression, effectively seeding the model with a strong symbolic prior.25  
2. **Stage 2: Fine-Tuning with Neural ODEs.** The pre-trained SymNet is then fine-tuned within a standard Neural ODE framework. The parameters of the symbolic network are adjusted by minimizing the prediction error over time, as computed by an ODE solver. This stage allows the model to refine the symbolic structure to better fit the observed data trajectories.1  
3. **Stage 3: Residual Learning with a General Neural Network (GeNN).** To capture any complex dynamics that cannot be expressed by the learned symbolic form, a general-purpose neural network (GeNN) is trained on the residuals. This hybrid approach ensures high accuracy while preserving a core of interpretable, symbolic dynamics.1

This methodology yields a model with significantly enhanced interpretability and extrapolation capabilities compared to baseline methods.1 By explicitly searching for a symbolic structure, SNODEs can be applied to scientific problems such as system bifurcation analysis, control, and even the discovery of new physical equations from data. Furthermore, the framework has been successfully applied to partial differential equation (PDE) systems through the use of Fourier analysis, achieving resolution-invariant modeling that is independent of the spatial grid.1

### **2.2 Beyond First-Order Gradients: High-Order Flow Expansions with Event Transition Tensors**

While SNODEs address interpretability by changing the structure of $f$, another line of research seeks to develop more powerful tools for analyzing the learned dynamics, even when $f$ remains a black box. Existing analytical approaches are largely restricted to first-order gradient information, which provides only a local, linear approximation of the system's behavior and limits the depth of achievable insight.3

To overcome this, Izzo et al. introduce **Event Transition Tensors**, a framework based on high-order differentials that provides a rigorous, non-linear mathematical description of the flow generated by a Neural ODE.3 The "flow" represents the set of all possible trajectories generated by the ODE, and this framework allows for its high-order Taylor expansion. These tensors are complex mathematical constructs that capture the higher-order sensitivities of the system's final state with respect to its initial state and parameters, up to a generic "event manifold" (e.g., a terminal condition or a boundary crossing).3

The versatility of this approach is demonstrated across several compelling applications 3:

* **Uncertainty Characterization:** In a data-driven prey-predator control model, the tensors are used to analyze how uncertainties in the initial state propagate through the learned dynamics.  
* **Analysis of Optimal Control:** The framework is applied to analyze the dynamics of a neural optimal feedback controller, providing deeper insights into its behavior.  
* **Hamiltonian Systems:** For a three-body problem modeled with a neural Hamiltonian ODE, the tensors are used to map landing trajectories, showcasing their utility in complex physical systems.

This work represents a significant advancement in the analytical toolkit for Neural ODEs. By providing explicit mathematical structures to describe the learned dynamics, Event Transition Tensors enhance the rigor and explainability of these models, contributing to a deeper theoretical foundation and building trust in their deployment in safety-critical domains.3

### **2.3 Rethinking Latent Trajectories: The Method of Characteristics in C-NODEs**

A subtle but important limitation of the standard Neural ODE formulation is that it defines a single, continuous vector field through which all latent trajectories must flow. This imposes a strong topological constraint: trajectories cannot intersect. This limits the class of transformations the model can learn. The Characteristic-Curve NODE (C-NODE), proposed in a 2025 NeurIPS paper, addresses this limitation by drawing inspiration from the theory of first-order quasi-linear PDEs.4

Instead of modeling the evolution of latent variables directly, C-NODEs parameterize their evolution along a family of **characteristic curves**. In the theory of PDEs, a transport equation describes the propagation of a quantity through time and space, and its solution can be found by solving a system of ODEs along these characteristic curves. By adapting this concept, C-NODEs allow for a more expressive evolution of the latent space, capable of learning intersecting trajectories and representing functions that are not expressible by standard NODEs.4

The authors prove that C-NODEs are more expressive than their predecessors and are universal approximators of homeomorphisms. This theoretical enhancement translates into tangible performance gains. Empirical results on benchmark classification (CIFAR-10, SVHN, MNIST) and density estimation tasks demonstrate that C-NODEs achieve improved accuracy and computational efficiency, requiring a lower number of function evaluations compared to baseline NODE methods under a similar computational budget.4 This work shows that by incorporating more sophisticated mathematical machinery into the core architecture, it is possible to overcome fundamental representational bottlenecks.

### **2.4 Modeling Meta-Dynamics: Koopman Operators for Evolving ODE Parameters (KoNODE)**

Standard NODE-based methods typically assume that the parameters $\\theta$ of the dynamics function $f$ are static, learned once during training and fixed thereafter. This limits the model's ability to adapt to changing environments or capture systems whose governing rules themselves evolve over time.29 The KoNODE framework addresses this by introducing a hierarchical approach to modeling dynamics.

KoNODE operates on three levels 29:

1. **Observed State Dynamics:** The top level models the evolution of the observed state, $z(t)$, governed by a Neural ODE, $\\frac{dz(t)}{dt} \= f(z(t), \\theta(t))$, but with time-varying parameters $\\theta(t)$.  
2. **Parameter Dynamics:** The middle level models the evolution of these parameters $\\theta(t)$ themselves.  
3. **Koopman Linear Dynamics:** The deepest level captures the fundamental driving rules of the parameter dynamics. It uses **Koopman operator theory**, a mathematical tool that can find a linear representation for complex nonlinear dynamical systems, to model the evolution of $\\theta(t)$.

This hierarchical structure provides two critical advantages. First, the simple, intrinsic linear dynamics learned by the Koopman operator are often more stable and easier to extrapolate than the complex, nonlinear surface dynamics of $z(t)$. This leads to significant improvements in **long-term prediction**. Second, the time-evolving parameters grant the model enhanced **generalization ability**, allowing it to adapt to new temporal patterns not seen during training.29 By uncovering the simpler patterns that govern the evolution of the system's rules, KoNODE offers a more powerful and mathematically interpretable understanding of the system's behavior.

The collective advancements in this section point to a clear and powerful trend. The field is moving beyond the initial conception of Neural ODEs as simply "infinitely deep ResNets" and is reintegrating them into the broader world of dynamical systems and mathematical physics. The vocabulary of research is shifting from "layers" and "activations" to "vector fields," "flows," "characteristic curves," "Hamiltonians," and "Koopman operators." This mathematization is not merely an academic exercise; it is a direct and necessary consequence of the pursuit of greater interpretability, expressivity, and robustness. This creates a powerful bridge between the data-driven paradigm of machine learning and the principle-driven paradigm of scientific modeling, enabling the potential for genuine scientific discovery. It also suggests a future where a distinction may arise between general-purpose, black-box NODEs and highly specialized, "white-box" mathematical NODEs tailored for specific scientific and engineering domains.

## **III. The Proliferation of Hybrid Models: Integrating Neural ODEs with Advanced Architectures**

While core theoretical advancements have deepened our understanding of Neural ODEs, another major trend in 2025 is their integration into other state-of-the-art architectures. This evolution positions the Neural ODE not just as a standalone model, but as a fundamental "dynamics module"—a powerful building block that can be inserted into other frameworks to imbue them with a notion of continuous evolution. This hybridization unlocks new capabilities for modeling complex systems that exhibit both structured relationships and continuous dynamics.

### **3.1 Modeling Spatio-Temporal Systems: A Deep Dive into Graph Neural ODEs (GDEs)**

Perhaps the most natural and powerful hybridization is the fusion of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with differential equations. GNNs excel at learning from data with relational or graph-based structures, capturing spatial dependencies, while DEs provide a principled framework for modeling continuous temporal dynamics. The synergy between these two has given rise to a burgeoning class of models known as Graph Neural Differential Equations (GDEs), which are uniquely suited for learning on systems that evolve over both space and time.6

A comprehensive 2025 survey by Liu et al. provides a systematic overview of this rapidly growing field. GDEs are categorized based on the role the GNN plays within the differential equation framework: it can serve as an encoder to map input features into a latent space, a decoder to map evolved latent states to an output, or, most powerfully, it can directly parameterize the dynamics function $f$ of the differential equation itself, thereby integrating the graph structure into the continuous-time evolution.6 This integration has proven invaluable across numerous scientific and industrial domains.

#### **3.1.1 GDEs for Molecular Dynamics and Scientific Computing**

A key challenge in computational science is the accurate prediction of long-horizon molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. Existing deep learning methods often struggle to maintain fidelity over extended simulations because they fail to capture the complex interplay of interactions across distinct spatial and temporal scales—from high-frequency local atomic vibrations to low-frequency global conformational changes of a protein.31

The **Graph Fourier Neural ODE (GF-NODE)** is a state-of-the-art GDE designed to address this challenge. Its architecture explicitly separates spatial and temporal modeling 31:

1. **Spatial Frequency Decomposition:** It first uses a graph Fourier transform, based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian, to decompose the molecular configuration into multiple spatial frequency modes. This separates the global (low-frequency) structure from the local (high-frequency) details.  
2. **Continuous-Time Evolution:** A learnable Neural ODE module then evolves these frequency components in continuous time, allowing it to capture the dynamics at each spatial scale.  
3. **Reconstruction:** Finally, an inverse graph Fourier transform reconstructs the updated molecular geometry.

By explicitly modeling phenomena at different frequencies in this unified pipeline, GF-NODE captures long-range correlations and local fluctuations more effectively than previous methods. Theoretical analysis connecting graph Laplacian eigenvalues to temporal dynamics scales, validated by empirical results on challenging MD benchmarks, demonstrates that GF-NODE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving essential geometrical features over long simulations.31

#### **3.1.2 Specialized GDEs for Diverse Domains**

The versatility of the GDE framework is evident in its application across a wide range of specialized domains in 2025:

* **Biology:** The **PerturbODE** framework leverages biologically informative Neural ODEs to model the continuous trajectories of cell states following genetic perturbations. By learning these dynamics, the model can infer the underlying causal gene regulatory network (GRN), providing a powerful tool for systems biology.32  
* **Recommendation Systems:** The **CDE-CF** model introduces Graph Neural *Controlled* Differential Equations for collaborative filtering. The authors argue that in dynamic recommendation environments, the graph convolution process should not be static. By allowing the weights of the graph convolution to be controlled by a continuous function within the ODE, the model can adapt its message-passing over time, leading to superior performance compared to both GCN-based and standard Graph ODE-based methods.33  
* **Emotion Recognition:** The **Dynamic Graph Neural ODE Network (DGODE)** is proposed for multimodal emotion recognition in conversations. It models a conversation as a dynamic graph of speakers and uses a graph ODE to characterize the continuous evolution of their emotional states. This approach effectively captures temporal dependencies and alleviates the overfitting and over-smoothing problems common in deep GCNs.34  
* **Federated Learning:** To address privacy concerns in large-scale graph learning, a novel method combines **Federated Spectral Graph Transformers with Neural ODEs**. This architecture enables privacy-preserving training on distributed, non-IID graphs, which is crucial for real-world applications like social network analysis, recommendation systems, and fraud detection where data cannot be centralized.35

### **3.2 Continuous-Depth Transformers: The Neural ODE Transformer Architecture**

The concept of continuous depth has also been extended to the Transformer architecture, the dominant model in natural language processing. Tong et al. propose the **Neural ODE Transformer**, a model that re-imagines the discrete stack of Transformer blocks as a continuous flow.7

In this architecture, all the weights of the attention and feed-forward blocks are parameterized by neural networks that take a continuous layer index, $t$, as an input. This transforms the entire model into a highly flexible, non-autonomous neural ODE. This continuous perspective is not just an architectural curiosity; it unlocks powerful new tools for analyzing the inner workings of these complex models. For instance, spectral analysis of the model's Jacobian reveals a continuous increase in eigenvalue magnitudes with depth, a finding that challenges the common weight-sharing assumption used in many theoretical studies of deep networks. Furthermore, the Lyapunov exponent, a concept from dynamical systems theory, can be used to examine token-level sensitivity and trace how information propagates through the continuous depth of the model, enhancing interpretability.7

Beyond these analytical benefits, the Neural ODE Transformer demonstrates strong empirical performance, achieving results comparable to or better than vanilla transformers across various configurations and datasets. It also offers more flexible fine-tuning capabilities, as the continuous-depth formulation can be adapted to different architectural constraints or computational budgets at inference time.7

### **3.3 Probabilistic Latent Dynamics: Combining VAEs and Neural ODEs for Model Order Reduction (B-NODE)**

Another powerful hybrid model to emerge in 2025 is the **Balanced Neural ODE (B-NODE)**, which combines Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Neural ODEs to create fast and accurate reduced-order surrogate models for complex dynamical systems.5 VAEs are powerful tools for learning a low-dimensional latent representation of high-dimensional data, while Neural ODEs excel at learning the dynamics within that representation.

A key challenge for prior "Latent ODE" models was their struggle with systems driven by time-varying inputs. The B-NODE framework, proposed by Aka et al., introduces a critical innovation to solve this: it **continuously propagates the variational parameters** ($\\mu$ and $\\sigma$) of the latent distribution through time using a Neural ODE.5 This establishes fixed "information channels" in the latent space, allowing the model to robustly handle time-varying external signals.

This architecture enables probabilistic time-series modeling by adaptively assigning stochastic noise during training, a technique that is known to improve the convergence of Neural ODEs.5 The B-NODE framework is flexible enough to learn both nonlinear reduced-order models and linear approximations of the Koopman operator, a powerful tool for analyzing dynamical systems, without needing to predefine the dimensionality of the operator.5

The proliferation of these hybrid models demonstrates a significant shift in the role of Neural ODEs within the broader machine learning ecosystem. They are evolving from a standalone architecture into a versatile and fundamental building block. A GNN describes static relationships; a GDE describes how those relationships evolve continuously. A Transformer performs a discrete sequence of processing steps; a Neural ODE Transformer makes that processing continuous. A VAE learns a static latent representation; a B-NODE learns the dynamics within that representation. This pattern suggests that the primary long-term value of Neural ODEs may lie in their ability to "dynamify" other architectures. Any model that involves a sequence of similar operations is a candidate for being re-conceptualized as a continuous flow, potentially unlocking new analytical tools, improved performance, and a more principled approach to modeling dynamic phenomena.

## **IV. Physics-Informed and Mechanistic Neural ODEs**

A particularly impactful direction of Neural ODE research in 2025 has been their integration with physical principles and mechanistic models. In scientific and engineering domains, purely data-driven "black-box" models are often insufficient due to data scarcity, the need for extrapolation, and the requirement for predictions to be physically consistent. By building known scientific laws and domain knowledge directly into the architecture, these physics-informed models leverage the strengths of both paradigms: the strong inductive bias of first-principles models and the flexibility of neural networks to learn complex, unknown relationships from data.

### **4.1 Modeling Material Inelasticity: The Attention-Based ISV-NODE Framework**

Modeling the constitutive behavior of solid materials is a formidable challenge. Materials exhibit a wide spectrum of behaviors—from perfectly elastic (conservative, reversible deformation) to viscoelastic (time-dependent dissipation) and elastoplastic (rate-independent dissipation after a yield point).14 A universal model must not only capture these diverse behaviors but also the sharp, nonlinear transitions between them.

To address this, Jones & Fuhg propose a significant enhancement to the **Internal State Variable-Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ISV-NODE)** framework.14 This data-driven, physics-constrained approach models the material's stress response based on observable deformation and inferred, unobservable internal state variables that capture the history of the material. The 2025 enhancements are multifold 14:

1. **Physics-Constrained Stress Potential:** The model for the stress potential, which relates strain to stress, is formulated using a **partially input convex neural network (pICNN)**. This architectural choice ensures by construction that the learned potential satisfies fundamental thermodynamic stability criteria, such as polyconvexity, which are crucial for physically realistic behavior.14  
2. **Attention-Based Gating for Dissipation:** The core innovation lies in the model for the evolution of the internal states (the "flow" model), which is governed by a Neural ODE. This NODE is enhanced with a novel **attention-based gating mechanism**. This gate learns to dynamically control the flow of the internal states. In conservative (elastic) regimes, the gate can effectively "turn off" the NODE, ensuring that no dissipation occurs and energy is conserved. When the material enters a dissipative regime (e.g., plastic yielding), the gate activates the NODE, allowing the internal states to evolve and dissipate energy. This mechanism enables the model to learn the sharp transitions between conservative and dissipative behavior directly from data, without any preconceived assumptions.14

This architecture represents a significant step towards a universal data-driven constitutive model. By embedding thermodynamic principles directly into the network structure and using a learnable attention mechanism to navigate different physical regimes, the model can accurately capture the complex, path-dependent response of a wide range of materials, bridging a critical gap in computational materials science.37

### **4.2 Automatic Sparsification of Hybrid Mechanistic Models for Healthcare**

In fields like healthcare and pharmacology, researchers often have access to mechanistic models based on systems of ODEs that describe biological or chemical processes (e.g., pharmacokinetics). However, these models are often incomplete or simplified. Hybrid models that integrate these known mechanistic ODEs with a Neural ODE component—to learn the unknown or unmodeled dynamics—offer a powerful combination of inductive bias and flexibility, especially in data-scarce settings.40

A key challenge, however, is that the initial mechanistic model may be overly complex, including states or interactions that are not relevant for the specific prediction task. This can lead to training inefficiency, poor generalization, and overfitting. To address this, Zou & Tian propose a novel pipeline for the **automatic and structure-aware sparsification of hybrid neural ODEs**.40

Their approach combines domain-informed graph modifications with data-driven regularization to automatically prune the mechanistic part of the model. By representing the mechanistic model as a graph of interacting states, the pipeline learns to identify and remove superfluous states and connections, effectively performing model reduction. This data-driven sparsification improves predictive performance and model stability while retaining the core mechanistic interpretability that is crucial for healthcare applications. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that this method achieves the desired sparsity and robustness, establishing an effective solution for building parsimonious and reliable hybrid models in critical domains.40

### **4.3 General Frameworks for Physics-Enhanced Neural ODEs (PeNODEs)**

The specific examples above are part of a broader trend toward formalizing the integration of domain knowledge into continuous-depth models. This has led to the development of more general frameworks, often referred to as **Physics-enhanced Neural ODEs (PeNODEs)**.41 These frameworks aim to provide systematic ways to incorporate physical constraints (e.g., conservation laws, symmetries) into the training process. Often, this involves leveraging advanced training techniques, such as the direct collocation and nonlinear programming methods discussed later, to handle these constraints effectively. This formalization is crucial for moving beyond bespoke solutions and creating a principled methodology for scientific machine learning with Neural ODEs.

The success of these physics-informed and mechanistic models reveals a crucial pattern. The data-driven paradigm is at its most powerful when it does not start from a blank slate. By building the known laws of physics or biology directly into the model's architecture, the Neural ODE component is relieved of the burden of learning these first principles from scratch. Instead, it is free to focus on its primary strength: learning the complex, nonlinear, and often unknown functions and interactions that are too difficult to model from theory alone. The attention gate in the ISV-NODE, for example, is not learning thermodynamics; it is learning *when* to switch between different thermodynamically consistent regimes. This represents a powerful template for AI in science, shifting the role of the machine learning model from a "universal function approximator" to a "discoverer of unknown functions within a known formal structure." This approach leads to models that are more data-efficient, robust, generalizable, and, critically, interpretable to domain experts.

## **V. Enhancing Training Dynamics: Efficiency, Stability, and Numerical Precision**

While architectural and theoretical innovations have expanded the capabilities of Neural ODEs, a parallel and equally critical line of research in 2025 has focused on addressing the practical engineering challenges that have historically hindered their widespread adoption. The computational expense of training, numerical instability with certain classes of problems, and the choice of solver are fundamental issues that must be overcome to make Neural ODEs a scalable and reliable technology. The work in this area signals an important phase of "engineering maturation" for the field.

### **5.1 Tackling Stiffness: Data-Driven Time Reparameterization**

One of the most significant practical hurdles for Neural ODEs is the problem of **stiffness**.10 A stiff ODE is one where the solution contains components that evolve on vastly different time scales. When using standard explicit numerical solvers (like many Runge-Kutta methods), the step size is constrained by the fastest-evolving, most unstable component, even if that component contributes little to the overall solution. This forces the solver to take an enormous number of tiny steps, making both training and inference prohibitively slow and computationally expensive.10

Caldana & Hesthaven propose an ingenious solution to this problem by introducing a **data-driven time reparameterization**.10 Their method avoids solving the stiff system directly with an expensive implicit solver at inference time. The process involves two key stages:

1. **Inducing a Time Map:** During a preparatory phase, an implicit solver (which is stable for stiff systems) is used on a reference solution. The adaptive time-stepping of this solver naturally takes small steps in "stiff" regions and larger steps in "non-stiff" regions. This sequence of adaptive steps is used to induce a data-driven map that effectively "stretches" time in the stiff regions and "compresses" it elsewhere.  
2. **Learning in Non-Stiff Time:** This time map is used to transform the original, stiff dynamical system into a new, non-stiff system. A Neural ODE can then be trained to learn the dynamics in this reparameterized time. Because the new system is non-stiff, it can be solved efficiently and cheaply using a standard explicit integration scheme. A separate, simple neural network learns the inverse map to connect the state space back to the original, physical time.

This approach cleverly offloads the challenge of stiffness into a learned reparameterization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method yields significant improvements in efficiency for Neural ODE inference on stiff systems, all while maintaining robustness and accuracy. This makes NODEs a much more practical tool for applications like model order reduction in engineering, where stiff dynamics are commonplace.10

### **5.2 Accelerating Convergence: Simultaneous Optimization via Direct Collocation**

The standard training procedure for Neural ODEs is inherently sequential and computationally intensive. In each iteration, an ODE solver must integrate the system's dynamics forward in time to compute the output, and then the adjoint dynamics are integrated backward to compute gradients.8 This repeated, iterative simulation is a major performance bottleneck.

Shapovalova & Tsay present a fundamentally different and faster training alternative based on **simultaneous optimization**.8 Their method recasts the entire training problem from a simulation task into a single, large-scale nonlinear optimization problem. This is achieved using a **collocation-based, fully discretized formulation**:

1. **Discretization:** The continuous time interval is discretized using a set of collocation points. The solution to the ODE is approximated by a polynomial (e.g., a linear combination of Lagrange polynomials) that passes through the unknown state values at these points.  
2. **Algebraic Constraints:** The requirement that this polynomial solution must satisfy the differential equation at each collocation point is converted into a set of algebraic equality constraints.  
3. **Simultaneous Optimization:** The training objective (e.g., minimizing the mean squared error between the predicted trajectory and observed data) and these collocation constraints are combined into a single large nonlinear program. A specialized solver, such as the Interior Point OPTimizer (IPOPT), is then used to solve for all the unknowns—both the state values at the collocation points and the parameters $\\theta$ of the neural network—*simultaneously*.8

This approach avoids the sequential nature of traditional training. On benchmark problems like the Van der Pol Oscillator, this simultaneous framework demonstrates significantly faster convergence in terms of both training and testing MSE when compared to standard sequential implementations in popular frameworks like JAX and PyTorch. The method can achieve better performance with smaller networks, suggesting that the improved optimization landscape leads to more effective use of model parameters.8

### **5.3 Innovations in Numerical Solvers: The Modified TR-BDF2 Method**

The performance of a Neural ODE is inextricably linked to the numerical solver used to integrate its dynamics. While adaptive Runge-Kutta methods are common, research in 2025 is actively exploring more advanced and specialized solvers to improve the trade-off between accuracy, stability, and computational cost.43

A paper presented at the EurasianSciEnTech 2025 conference investigates the application of a recently developed implicit numerical method, the **modified Trapezoidal Rule with Second Order Backward Differentiation (I-TR-BDF2)**, for training Neural ODEs.43 This method, originally proposed for power electronics simulations, is a multi-step implicit solver known for its stability properties.

The study evaluates the performance of I-TR-BDF2 and the classical TR-BDF2 against the widely used fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method on the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, a nonlinear dynamical system. The results show that, for the tested initial conditions, the TR-BDF2 family of solvers generally **outperforms RK4** in terms of mean absolute error. Furthermore, these methods require only **three function evaluations** per step, compared to the four required by RK4, making them computationally more efficient.43 These findings suggest that there are significant gains to be made by moving beyond default explicit solvers and exploring the rich literature of numerical methods, particularly implicit and semi-implicit schemes, which can offer superior stability and accuracy for certain classes of problems.

The intense focus on these engineering aspects—stiffness, optimization frameworks, and solver choice—is a clear indicator of the field's maturation. The initial excitement surrounding the theoretical elegance of Neural ODEs is now being complemented by the rigorous engineering required to make them practical, scalable, and robust for real-world deployment. These are not minor tweaks but fundamental redesigns of the training and inference pipelines. This trend suggests that Neural ODEs are being treated less like conventional neural networks and more like the complex dynamical systems they are designed to model, a shift that will be critical for their widespread adoption in demanding scientific and industrial applications.

## **VI. Regularization and Normalization in Continuous-Depth Models**

As Neural ODEs have matured, it has become clear that techniques developed for discrete deep networks, such as Batch Normalization and standard regularization methods, do not always translate effectively to the continuous-depth setting. The unique properties and challenges of continuous-time models—particularly the central role of the integration time and the dynamics of the vector field—necessitate a new, "native" toolkit of methods specifically designed to control their behavior. The research of 2025 has made significant strides in developing this toolkit, with novel approaches to regularization and normalization that are purpose-built for the continuous paradigm.

### **6.1 STEER: Simple Temporal Regularization by Stochastic Time Warping**

A common issue during the training of Neural ODEs is that the learned dynamics $f$ can become overly complex. This complexity forces the adaptive solver to take more steps to maintain the desired error tolerance, significantly increasing the number of function evaluations (NFE) and slowing down training.44

The **Simple Temporal Regularization (STEER)** technique offers an elegant and effective solution to this problem. Instead of regularizing the parameters $\\theta$ or the activations directly, STEER regularizes the **temporal dimension** of the integration itself. The method is straightforward: during each training iteration, the final integration time $t\_1$ is randomly perturbed.44 For example, the solver integrates not to a fixed $t\_1$, but to a time $T$ sampled uniformly from an interval $\[t\_1 \- b, t\_1 \+ b\]$.

This simple act of stochastic time warping has a profound regularizing effect. It encourages the model to learn a simpler vector field, as the dynamics must be well-behaved over a range of integration times. This is equivalent to performing a variable number of transformations on the input in each iteration, introducing a novel form of stochasticity that is unique to continuous-depth models. STEER is shown to have negligible computational overhead, is orthogonal to and can be combined with other regularization techniques, and empirically demonstrates significant reductions in training time while often improving final model performance across a wide variety of tasks, including continuous normalizing flows, time-series modeling, and image recognition.44

### **6.2 Inducing Robustness: Contractivity-Promoting Regularization for Convolutional NODEs**

The fragility of neural networks to input noise and adversarial attacks is a well-known problem. For Neural ODEs, their foundation in dynamical systems theory offers a unique pathway to enhancing robustness. Zakwan et al. propose a method to improve the robustness of **Convolutional Neural ODEs (CNODEs)** by leveraging **contraction theory**.13

A dynamical system is said to be contractive if any two trajectories, regardless of their initial conditions, converge towards each other exponentially fast. If a Neural ODE is contractive, it means that the effect of a small perturbation to its input will diminish as it propagates through the continuous depth of the model. This property inherently leads to robustness, as it bounds the Lipschitz constant of the input-output map to be less than one.13

Contractivity can be enforced by ensuring that the Jacobian of the dynamics function satisfies certain properties. While this can be achieved with a regularization term involving the full Jacobian, this approach is computationally expensive. The key innovation of this work is the derivation of a much simpler and more efficient regularization scheme. For a wide class of NODEs that use slope-restricted activation functions, the authors show that contractivity can be promoted by a simple **weight regularization term** that penalizes the norms of the weight matrices (or convolution filters in the case of CNODEs), completely avoiding the need to compute the Jacobian.13

The effectiveness of this contractivity-promoting regularization is demonstrated on the MNIST and FashionMNIST image classification benchmarks. When subjected to Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise, and adversarial attacks (FGSM and PGD), the regularized CNODEs achieve significantly higher classification accuracy—with improvements of up to 34%—compared to their unregularized counterparts. This work provides a practical and computationally efficient method for building certifiably more robust continuous-depth models.13

### **6.3 Temporal Adaptive Batch Normalization (TA-BN): A Continuous Analogue for Normalization**

Batch Normalization (BN) has been a cornerstone of deep learning, enabling the training of very deep discrete networks by stabilizing distributions of layer activations. However, traditional BN is fundamentally mismatched with the continuous-time nature of Neural ODEs. BN operates on discrete mini-batches at fixed layers, whereas a NODE operates continuously over time. This mismatch has been a major obstacle to building deeper and more complex NODE architectures, as stacking NODE blocks often leads to training instability.12

To bridge this gap, a 2024 NeurIPS paper introduces **Temporal Adaptive Batch Normalization (TA-BN)**, a novel technique designed to be the continuous-time analogue of traditional BN.12 While the specific mechanics are not detailed in the provided materials, the core idea is to perform normalization in a way that is consistent with the continuous evolution of the hidden state.

The impact of this innovation is significant. Empirical findings reveal that TA-BN enables the successful stacking of more layers within Neural ODEs, enhancing their depth and expressive power. A model architecture consisting of a single "unmixed" Neural ODE block followed by a linear layer, when equipped with TA-BN, achieves 91.1% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 with only 2.2 million parameters. This level of parameter efficiency approaches that of highly optimized discrete architectures like MobileNetV2, demonstrating that with the right normalization scheme, NODEs can be architecturally competitive with state-of-the-art discrete networks.12

The development of these specialized techniques—STEER, contractivity regularization, and TA-BN—marks a crucial step in the evolution of Neural ODEs. The field is moving beyond adapting tools from the discrete deep learning world and is now inventing a native toolkit of methods designed specifically for the unique properties and challenges of continuous-depth models. This is the hallmark of a maturing, independent subfield. This new toolkit opens up further research avenues into what other core deep learning concepts, such as dropout or layer-wise learning, might look like in a continuous-time context, and it is fundamental to building more stable, robust, and efficient Neural ODEs.

## **VII. Deepening Interpretability and Explainability**

One of the most compelling long-term promises of Neural ODEs is their potential for enhanced interpretability. In contrast to many discrete deep learning models where explainability is often a post-hoc exercise attempted with external tools, for Neural ODEs, interpretability can be an intrinsic property derived directly from the model's mathematical structure. The very object that a Neural ODE learns—a vector field that governs the system's dynamics—is itself an explanatory object. The research of 2025 has begun to capitalize on this unique characteristic, deploying NODEs in high-stakes domains where the "why" behind a prediction is as critical as the "what."

### **7.1 Transparent AI for Healthcare: Interpretable Classifiers for Textual Data**

The "black box" nature of complex models like Transformers and LSTMs has created a barrier to their adoption in critical fields such as healthcare, where clinicians and regulators demand transparency and accountability in decision-making.20 In response to this, Shi Li's 2025 work explores the use of Neural ODEs as inherently interpretable classifiers, pioneering their application to the continuous processing of textual data from electronic health records.21

In this framework, a patient's clinical notes are represented as a sequence of features (e.g., from TF-IDF), and the Neural ODE learns the continuous dynamics of how this feature representation evolves over the sequence to arrive at a prediction (e.g., hospital outcome). The model's transparency is realized through two powerful, native visualization tools 21:

1. **Saliency Maps:** Because the model's prediction is a direct result of integrating the dynamics, it is possible to compute the importance of each input feature. This allows for the generation of saliency maps that highlight precisely which words or phrases in the clinical text had the most significant influence on the classification decision, providing direct, human-readable evidence for the model's reasoning.  
2. **Vector Field Visualization:** The learned ODE vector field itself can be projected onto a 2D plane and visualized. This visualization provides an intuitive, geometric picture of the model's decision-making process. One can observe how the hidden state "flows" through the latent space, with different classes corresponding to different basins of attraction. This allows a user to see not just the final decision, but the entire dynamic pathway that led to it.

This work marks a significant step towards building trustworthy AI for healthcare. While there may sometimes be a trade-off in raw predictive accuracy compared to larger, more opaque models, the value of providing clear, interpretable, and mathematically grounded explanations for clinical predictions is immense.21

### **7.2 Forecasting Critical Transitions: Learning and Predicting System Bifurcations**

The ability of Neural ODEs to learn the underlying vector field of a dynamical system from observational data makes them a powerful tool for scientific discovery. A 2025 paper demonstrates this by applying NODEs to learn parameter-dependent vector fields from time-series data in order to identify and predict **bifurcations**—sudden, qualitative shifts in a system's behavior as a parameter is varied.45

The key finding of this research is that a well-trained Neural ODE can not only recover the known bifurcation structure within the parameter range of the training data but can also successfully **forecast bifurcations *beyond* the parameter regions** it was trained on. This remarkable extrapolation capability arises because, rather than simply interpolating between data points, the model has captured a more fundamental representation of the system's governing laws encoded in the vector field.

The significance of this result is profound. It positions Neural ODEs as a potential tool for predicting critical transitions and tipping points in a wide range of complex systems, such as climate models, financial markets, or ecological systems. The study also notes that the model's accuracy depends more on the quality of information that can be inferred from the training data than on the sheer quantity of data available, highlighting the importance of data that richly explores the system's dynamics.45 This work reinforces the idea that when NODEs are successful, they provide more than just a prediction; they provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms of the system being modeled.

These applications underscore a unique advantage of the Neural ODE paradigm. They leverage the language of dynamical systems—vector fields, flows, attractors, and bifurcations—as the language of explanation. This provides a form of interpretability that is much deeper and more native to the model's structure than what is typically available for discrete architectures. This could prove to be a decisive advantage for Neural ODEs in scientific, engineering, and regulated industries where verifiability and mechanistic understanding are paramount.

## **VIII. Synthesis and Future Research Trajectories**

### **8.1 Identifying Convergent Trends in Neural ODE Research**

The landscape of Neural ODE research in 2025 is one of dynamic growth and maturation. The advancements detailed in this report are not isolated achievements but rather interconnected components of several broad, convergent trends that are shaping the future of continuous-depth models. Synthesizing these developments reveals a clear trajectory for the field.

First and foremost is the trend of **from analogy to formalism**. The initial conception of Neural ODEs as a continuous analogy for ResNets has given way to a more rigorous treatment of these models as formal mathematical objects. The introduction of Symbolic NODEs, Event Transition Tensors, and models based on characteristic curves and Koopman operators demonstrates a collective effort to replace or augment the unstructured black-box learner with principled mathematical structures. This shift is driven by the demand for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, verifiable, and capable of extrapolation—qualities that emerge from strong theoretical grounding.

Second, 2025 has solidified the role of the Neural ODE as a fundamental building block in **the rise of the hybrid**. Rather than competing with other architectures, Neural ODEs are increasingly being used to enhance them. Their integration as a "dynamics module" within GNNs, Transformers, and VAEs has created powerful new classes of models capable of handling complex spatio-temporal, sequential, and probabilistic tasks. This modularity is arguably one of the most significant long-term contributions of the Neural ODE paradigm, opening up a vast design space for future architectures.

Third, there is a clear focus on **engineering for practice**. The concerted effort to solve critical, real-world bottlenecks such as numerical stiffness, high training costs, and the need for appropriate normalization schemes signals the field's transition from a theoretical curiosity to a practical engineering discipline. Advances in time reparameterization, simultaneous optimization via collocation, and the development of continuous-time batch normalization are essential for making Neural ODEs scalable, robust, and competitive with established discrete models in production environments.

Finally, the research highlights a growing emphasis on **principled inductive bias**. Particularly in scientific machine learning, there is a recognition that starting from a blank slate is inefficient and often ineffective. Physics-informed models for materials science and mechanistic models for healthcare demonstrate a powerful new template: embedding known domain knowledge (e.g., physical laws, biological pathways) directly into the model's architecture. This allows the flexible Neural ODE component to focus its learning capacity on the unknown, nonlinear relationships within a constrained, physically plausible solution space, leading to more data-efficient and trustworthy models.

### **8.2 Persistent Challenges and Open Questions for the Field**

Despite the remarkable progress in 2025, several significant challenges and open questions remain, which will likely define the next phase of research in continuous-depth models.

* **Scalability:** While training efficiency has improved, it is still an open question whether the new methods can scale to the massive datasets and parameter counts of today's largest foundation models. Can simultaneous optimization techniques be effectively deployed in large-scale distributed training environments? Can the computational overhead of hybrid models like GDEs and Neural ODE Transformers be managed for billion-parameter models?  
* **Theoretical Guarantees:** The theoretical grounding of Neural ODEs is deepening, but many questions remain. A more complete understanding of their optimization landscapes, generalization properties under different regularization schemes, and the formal expressivity limits of various architectural choices (e.g., C-NODEs vs. standard NODEs) is needed.  
* **Higher-Order and Partial Differential Equations:** The current focus is overwhelmingly on systems of first-order ODEs. While some initial work has explored learning PDEs (e.g., SNODEs with Fourier analysis), the development of general, efficient, and stable Neural PDE frameworks remains a major frontier. This will be crucial for modeling a vast range of physical phenomena described by equations like the Navier-Stokes or Schrödinger equations.  
* **Automated Model Discovery and Causal Inference:** Frameworks like SNODE hint at the potential for automated scientific discovery. Can these be extended to fully automate the process of discovering governing equations from high-dimensional, noisy observational data? Furthermore, can the continuous-time framework of NODEs be more deeply connected with the theory of causal inference to learn causal relationships from time-series data?  
* **Software and Tooling:** The rapid pace of innovation has outstripped the development of standardized software tools. For broader community adoption, there is a critical need for robust, user-friendly, and well-documented libraries that integrate the latest numerical solvers, advanced training and regularization techniques, and easy-to-use interfaces for building the diverse range of hybrid architectures.

### **8.3 Concluding Remarks on the Trajectory of Continuous-Depth Models**

The research of 2025 has unequivocally demonstrated that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations have transcended their initial status as a novel curiosity to become a vibrant, essential, and rapidly evolving subfield of machine learning. The advancements of the past year have systematically addressed the foundational limitations of the original framework, transforming Neural ODEs into a more powerful, practical, and theoretically sound class of models.

Their future trajectory appears not to be one of replacing all discrete networks, but rather of carving out a unique and indispensable niche. They are emerging as the preeminent tool for modeling continuous dynamical phenomena, for seamlessly integrating first-principles domain knowledge with data-driven learning, and for building AI systems where interpretability is not an afterthought but a core design feature. The continued convergence of machine learning with classical mathematics and scientific computing, as exemplified by the work in this report, ensures that continuous-depth models will remain a fertile ground for innovation and a critical component in the quest to build more intelligent, robust, and trustworthy AI systems.
